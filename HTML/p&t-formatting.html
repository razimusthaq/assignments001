<p>A programming language is a formal language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer.Programming languages can be used to create programs that control the behaviour of a machine and/or to express algorithms precisely</p>

<p>C++ (pronounced as 'see plus plus') is a programming language that is general purpose, statically typed, free-form, multi-paradigm and compiled. It is regarded as an intermediate level language, as it comprises both high level and low-level language features.</p>

<p>Java is a computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriened, and specifically designed to have a few implementation dependencies as possible.

<p>Oxygen(O2) is one of the most important elements required to sustain life. Without it, our health begins to suffer and we die. Unhealthy or weak cells due to improper metabolism lower the natural immunity and are thus susceptible to viruses and lead the way to all kinds of serious health problems</p>
