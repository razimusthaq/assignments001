<br>
<p>A computer is an electronic device which is capable of receiving information (data) in a particular form and of performing a sequence of operations in accordance with a predetermined but variable set of procedural instructions (program) to produce a result in the form of information or signals.</p>
<br>
<h4><a id="cpu">CPU</a></h4>
<p>A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions.</p>
<h4><a id="ALU">ALU</a></h4>
<p>An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a combinational digital electronic circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers.</p>
<h2><a id="pgr">PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</a></h2>
<p>A programming language is a formal computer language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.</p>
<h4><a id="c">c</a></h4>
<p>C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations.</p>
<h4><a id="c++">C++</a></h4>
<p>C++ is an object oriented programming (OOP) language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an extension of C language.</p>
<h2><a id="dbms">DBMS</a></h2>
<p>A database management system (DBMS) is a computer software application that interacts with the user, other applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. A general-purpose DBMS is designed to allow the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases.</p>
<h4><a id="rdbms">RDBMS</a></h4>
<p>RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems like MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access. A Relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as introduced by E. F. Codd.</p>
<h4><a id="oodbms">OODBMS</a></h4>
<p>An object-oriented database management system (OODBMS) is a database management system that supports the creation and modeling of data as objects. OODBMS also includes support for classes of objects and the inheritance of class properties, and incorporates methods, subclasses and their objects.</p>
